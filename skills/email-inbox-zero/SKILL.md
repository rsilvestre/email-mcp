# Recipe: Inbox Zero

Process an inbox in the order that respects attention: what a person wrote,
first; what a machine sent, in bulk, last.

**Prerequisite:** the `email-mcp` base skill.

## The ordering, and why

The 📰 / 🤖 markers split the inbox along the only line that reliably predicts
whether a human is waiting: a person wrote it, or a system emitted it. Work the
unmarked mail first. It is usually a small fraction of the volume and nearly all
of the obligation.

Do **not** start with newsletters because they are easy to clear. Ending with a
tidy inbox and an unanswered colleague is a worse outcome than stopping halfway.

## Steps

### Step 1: See the shape of it

```
list_emails { "account": "perso", "mailbox": "INBOX", "seen": false, "pageSize": 100 }
```

Add `"preview": true` when the subject lines alone will not let the user decide
what to keep. It costs extra bytes per message, so ask for it deliberately.

Sort what comes back into three piles and report the counts before touching
anything:

```
Unread in INBOX: 87
  👤 personal      11
  🤖 automated     23
  📰 newsletter    53
```

The user should be able to say "just do the newsletters" before you have spent
their time on the rest.

### Step 2: Work the personal mail one at a time

For each unmarked message, read enough to decide — the thread when there is one:

```
get_thread { "account": "perso", "message_id": "<message-id>", "mailbox": "INBOX", "format": "stripped" }
```

`format: "stripped"` drops quoted chains and signatures, which is most of the
bytes in a long reply chain.

Then pick one:

**Needs a reply now** — draft it, show it, send only once approved:
```
save_draft { "account": "perso", "subject": "Re: …", "body": "…", "in_reply_to": "<message-id>" }
```

**Needs a reply later** — flag it and set a dated reminder. There is no snooze;
this is the honest substitute, and it does not hide the message:
```
mark_email     { "account": "perso", "id": "123", "mailbox": "INBOX", "action": "flag" }
create_reminder { "account": "perso", "email_id": "123", "mailbox": "INBOX", "title": "Reply to …", "due_date": "2026-09-12" }
```

**Needs filing** — move it:
```
move_email { "account": "perso", "emailId": "123", "sourceMailbox": "INBOX", "destinationMailbox": "Projects" }
```

**Done** — archive:
```
move_email { "account": "perso", "emailId": "123", "sourceMailbox": "INBOX", "destinationMailbox": "Archive" }
```

### Step 3: Batch the automated pile

Machine-generated mail rarely needs reading individually. Scan subjects for the
exceptions — a failed payment, an expiring credential, a security alert — pull
those out, then batch the rest:

```
bulk_action { "account": "perso", "mailbox": "INBOX", "action": "move", "ids": ["201","202"], "destination": "Archive" }
```

Confirm the count with the user before the first call. Up to 100 ids each.

### Step 4: Batch the newsletters

Same treatment, lower stakes. If the pile is large and recurring, this is a
signal rather than a chore — offer the `email-newsletter-cleanup` recipe instead
of clearing the same backlog again next week.

### Step 5: Verify and report

```
list_emails { "account": "perso", "mailbox": "INBOX", "seen": false, "pageSize": 100 }
```

Report the real end state, including what you deliberately left:

```
INBOX: 4 unread left
  3 flagged for reply, reminders set for Sep 12
  1 left unread — from your accountant, needs a decision I cannot make for you
```

## Tips

- Archive rather than delete. Deletion is irreversible and buys nothing here;
  reserve `delete_email` for cases the user explicitly asks for.
- Never mark a personal message read to clear a count. Unread is the user's own
  signal, and quietly consuming it destroys information.
- Stop and ask when a message needs a decision only the user can make. An inbox
  at zero that hid a real question is a failure dressed as success.
- On Gmail, moving out of INBOX is what archiving means; `list_mailboxes` shows
  the account's actual Archive folder, which is not always named `Archive`.
